# knight_tour_problem

The Knight's Tour problem is about finding a sequence of moves for the knight on a chessboard such that it visits every square on the board exactly one time, starting from che b1 square.
The time to arrive at a solution depends on the rule of choice for the next move.  
main.py 0 for a next-one choice  
main.py 1 for a random choice  
main.py 2 (or main.py) for a greedy choice (Warnsdorff's Rule)
